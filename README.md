# Agerent System

[Documentation Webpage](https://kotaanuj.github.io/agerent_systeb_doc/index.html)

## Overview

Agerent System is a modular and extensible conversational agent framework designed to leverage large language models (LLMs) alongside dynamic tool integration and advanced memory management. It provides a robust foundation for building intelligent agents with capabilities such as:
- **Memory Management:** Both basic and semantic memory to maintain conversation context.
- **LLM Integration:** Unified interface for multiple LLM providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Custom).
- **Tool Management:** Dynamically load and execute external tools using configuration files.
- **Advanced Features:**  
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
  - Agent Communication
  - Evaluation Framework for performance metrics
  - Multimodal Support (image and audio processing)
  - Streaming Responses for interactive experiences
  - Type Safety for robust input/output validation

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Install the required packages with:

```bash
pip install sentence-transformers faiss-cpu pillow
```

For GPU support with FAISS:

```bash
pip install faiss-gpu
```

## Usage

1. **Create an Agent Configuration:**  
   Create a JSON configuration file (e.g., `agent_config.json`) that defines your agent's properties, such as:
   ```json
   {
     "agent_name": "MathAssistant",
     "config": {
       "backstory": "I am a helpful assistant with math skills.",
       "task": "help users solve mathematical problems using my calculator tool when needed",
       "tools": ["calculator"],
       "memory": true,
       "memory_type": "basic",
       "prompt_template": ""
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Register Basic Tools:**  
   Use the provided utility to set up basic tools:
   ```python
   from tool import ToolManager
   ToolManager.setup_basic_config()
   ```

3. **Create and Run the Agent:**  
   Instantiate and run your agent as follows:
   ```python
   from agent import create_agent, run_agent

   agent = create_agent("agent_config.json", llm_provider="openai")
   response = run_agent(agent, "What is 2 + 2?")
   print("Agent Response:", response)
   ```

## Extending the Framework

- **Adding New Tools:**  
  Use `ToolManager.create_tool_config` to define new tools and implement their corresponding Python functions.
  
- **Switching Memory Modules:**  
  Update the configuration (`"memory_type": "semantic"`) to use semantic memory (powered by SentenceTransformers and FAISS) instead of basic memory.
  
- **Integrating New LLM Providers:**  
  Extend the `LLMProvider` class and update the provider selection logic in `llm_provider.py` to add custom integrations.
